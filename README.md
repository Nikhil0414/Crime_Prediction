# Crime_Prediction


The proposed methodology involves developing a violence detection system using deep learning techniques, starting with dataset collection and frame extraction. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model is then trained with multiple layers including convolutional, max-pooling, dropout regularization, and dense layers for classification. Data augmentation techniques enhance model generalization. The trained model is evaluated on a testing set before deployment. The objective is to create a real-time crime detection technology integrated with existing security systems, accessible through a Django-based website. Traditional CCTVs are transformed into proactive crime prevention tools using computer vision and deep learning models like CNNs, R-CNNs, and LSTMs. The software enables instant notifications for detected suspicious or violent activities, enhancing public safety. Over 500 categorized videos form the dataset for robust model training and deployment, sourced from the internet. This approach transitions surveillance from evidence collection to active crime detection, ensuring comprehensive surveillance for public safety.
